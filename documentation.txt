the formula for t test : 
t = (x̄ – μ) / (σ / √n)

Where,

t is the t-value,
x̄ is the Sample mean,
μ is the Population mean,
σ is the Sample standard deviation, and
n is the Sample size.

sample mean -
The sample mean, often denoted by x bar  , is a measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a set of data points in a sample. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the sample and then dividing by the total number of observations in the sample.


population mean - 
The population mean, often denoted by the Greek letter μ, is a statistical measure that represents the average value of a variable in an entire population.


sample standard deviation - 
The sample standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of data points within a sample. It quantifies the average deviation of data points from the sample mean.

r squarred -
R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables in a regression model. In other words, it measures the goodness of fit of the model.

Ordinary least squared-
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used in linear regression analysis to estimate the parameters of a linear model. It is one of the most common and widely used regression techniques due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

t value - 
In statistics, the t-value (or t-statistic) is a measure used to assess the statistical significance of the difference between the observed mean of a sample and a hypothetical population mean or the difference between two sample means
